## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Athan, but online and in most tech spaces, you'll see me go by my username, athanzxyt. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Princeton in an accelerated track studying computer science, operations research, sociology, and entrepreneurship (if that can even be learned). Currently, I'm helping build backend machine learning pipelines and advising with strategy at [Vytal](https://vytal.ai/), a startup I helped start with a few friends back in high school. On campus, I'm primarily involved with pursuing NLP HCI research under Christiane Fellbaum and working at [Prospect Student Ventures](https://psv.vc), Princeton's premier VC club that gives non-dilutive grants to local startups, as the Director of Founder Support (aka. ensuring portfolio companies don't die).
